### Steps to Implement GigeMultiplayerMod

1. **Create a Folder on Start**: Check if the folder exists when the mod starts. If it doesn't, create it.
2. **Create a Log File per User**: When a user connects, create a log file specific to that user.
3. **Log User Actions**: Whenever a user hits or kills a zombie, log the action along with the damage dealt in their respective log file.

### Sample Code Structure

Here's a basic structure in pseudo-code that you can adapt to your programming language and environment:

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

class GigeMultiplayerMod:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_folder = "UserLogs"
        self.user_logs = {}

        # Step 1: Create a folder if it doesn't exist
        self.create_log_folder()

    def create_log_folder(self):
        if not os.path.exists(self.log_folder):
            os.makedirs(self.log_folder)

    def on_user_connect(self, user_id):
        # Step 2: Create a log file for the user
        log_file_path = os.path.join(self.log_folder, f"{user_id}.log")
        if user_id not in self.user_logs:
            self.user_logs[user_id] = log_file_path
            with open(log_file_path, 'w') as log_file:
                log_file.write(f"Log for user: {user_id}\n")

    def log_action(self, user_id, action, damage):
        # Step 3: Log user actions
        if user_id in self.user_logs:
            log_file_path = self.user_logs[user_id]
            with open(log_file_path, 'a') as log_file:
                timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
                log_file.write(f"{timestamp} - {action} - Damage: {damage}\n")

    def on_user_hit_zombie(self, user_id, damage):
        self.log_action(user_id, "HIT ZOMBIE", damage)

    def on_user_kill_zombie(self, user_id, damage):
        self.log_action(user_id, "KILL ZOMBIE", damage)

# Example usage
mod = GigeMultiplayerMod()
mod.on_user_connect("User123")
mod.on_user_hit_zombie("User123", 50)
mod.on_user_kill_zombie("User123", 100)
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The `GigeMultiplayerMod` class initializes by creating a log folder if it doesn't exist.
2. **User Connection**: The `on_user_connect` method creates a log file for each user when they connect.
3. **Logging Actions**: The `log_action` method appends the action (hit or kill) along with the damage to the user's log file.
4. **User Actions**: The methods `on_user_hit_zombie` and `on_user_kill_zombie` are called to log specific actions.

### Integration

You will need to integrate this structure into your existing mod framework. Ensure that the methods for user connection and actions are called appropriately based on your game's event system.

### Testing

After implementing the code, test the following scenarios:
- A user connects and a log file is created.
- The user hits and kills zombies, and the actions are logged correctly.
- Check the log files to ensure the format and content are as expected.
